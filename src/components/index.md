# Components

Components are reusable UI elements that can be composed to create interfaces. Our component library provides a comprehensive set of UI building blocks to help you create consistent, accessible, and beautiful enterprise applications.

## Component Categories

Our components are organized into the following categories:

### Layout Components

Layout components provide structural organization for your content. They help establish visual hierarchy and ensure consistent spacing throughout your interface.

### Input Components

Input components allow users to enter data, make selections, and trigger actions. They form the foundation of interactive interfaces.

### Navigation Components

Navigation components help users move between different sections or pages of your application. They provide wayfinding and structure to the user experience.

### Feedback Components

Feedback components communicate information, status, and results of actions to users. They help users understand system state and provide guidance.

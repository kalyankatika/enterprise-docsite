# Migration Examples

This section provides examples that demonstrate different approaches to migrating legacy documentation into the Enterprise Design System. These examples show both preservation and conversion strategies.

## Available Examples

- [Legacy Component Preserved](/components/shared/migration-examples/legacy-component-preserved/) - Example of a component where the original structure was preserved
- [Legacy Page Converted](/components/shared/migration-examples/legacy-page-converted/) - Example of a documentation page that was fully converted to the new format

## Migration Approaches

The Enterprise Documentation System supports multiple approaches to handling legacy content:

### 1. Full Conversion

Converting legacy content completely to the new Markdown-based format with standardized structure, styling, and interactive elements.

### 2. Hybrid Approach

Wrapping legacy content with the new design system header/footer while preserving the original content rendering for complex components.

### 3. Reference Linking

For very complex legacy documentation systems, creating reference links in the new system that direct users to the original documents.

## Benefits of Migration

- **Consistent Navigation**: All documentation available through one navigation system
- **Improved Search**: Content more easily discovered through unified search
- **Maintained Context**: Legacy documentation presented in context with modern components
- **Gradual Transition**: Allows teams to transition over time rather than requiring a "big bang" migration

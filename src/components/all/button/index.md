# Button

Buttons enable users to trigger actions or events with a single click. They communicate what action will occur when the user interacts with them.

## Overview

Buttons are interactive elements that enable users to trigger actions throughout the interface. They should clearly communicate what will happen when pressed and provide visual feedback during interaction.

## Types

- **Primary**: High-emphasis buttons for main actions
- **Secondary**: Medium-emphasis buttons for secondary actions
- **Tertiary**: Low-emphasis buttons for tertiary actions
- **Danger**: For destructive actions that should be highlighted
- **Ghost**: Minimally visually intrusive buttons
- **Icon**: Buttons that consist primarily of an icon with optional text

## When to Use

- To submit forms
- To trigger modal dialogs
- To initiate a new action
- To proceed through a multi-step process
- To provide navigation options

## Best Practices

- Use clear, concise, and action-oriented labels
- Prioritize button hierarchy on each screen
- Maintain consistent positioning across similar screens
- Ensure buttons are large enough to be easily tapped on touch devices
- Avoid using too many buttons in one section
- Use standard button styles for recognizability

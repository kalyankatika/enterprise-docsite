# Checkbox

A checkbox allows users to select one or more items from a set, or to mark an item as selected.

## Overview

Checkboxes are form controls that allow users to select multiple options from a set or to toggle a single option on and off.

## Types

- **Standard**: Basic checkbox for selecting options
- **Indeterminate**: Represents a state that is neither checked nor unchecked, usually indicating that some but not all sub-items are selected
- **Disabled**: Non-interactive checkbox that cannot be toggled

## When to Use

- When users need to select multiple options from a list
- For binary choices like accepting terms and conditions 
- When toggling a feature or setting on or off
- For a "Select All" option that controls a group of related checkboxes

## Best Practices

- Use clear and concise labels for checkboxes
- Group related checkboxes together
- Organize checkboxes logically with the most common options first
- Avoid using too many checkboxes in a single form
- Consider using checkboxes instead of toggle switches for binary options when saving a setting requires an explicit action

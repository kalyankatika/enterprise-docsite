# Converted Legacy Documentation

This section contains documentation that has been migrated from legacy formats to our new documentation system. These pages were automatically converted to Markdown format and integrated into the navigation structure.

## Available Legacy Documentation

Browse the converted legacy documentation:

- [Legacy Component](/legacy-docs/converted/legacy-component/) - Example of a legacy component that was converted to the new format
- [Legacy Page](/legacy-docs/converted/legacy-page/) - Example of a general documentation page from a legacy system

## About the Conversion Process

These documents went through an automated conversion process that:

1. Extracted content from the source format
2. Preserved information structure and hierarchy
3. Applied consistent formatting rules
4. Integrated with the navigation system

# Preserved Legacy Documentation

This section contains legacy documentation that has been preserved in its original Nunjucks (.njk) format. Rather than converting these files to Markdown, we've kept them in their native format to ensure exact rendering and behavior of complex legacy components.

## Available Preserved Documentation

Browse the preserved legacy documentation:

- [Legacy Component](/legacy-docs/njk/legacy-component/) - Example of a complex component preserved in Nunjucks format
- [Legacy Page](/legacy-docs/njk/legacy-page/) - Example of a documentation page preserved in its original format

## About Preservation

Some legacy content is better preserved in its original format, especially when:

1. The component has complex interactive behavior
2. The layout relies on specific template features
3. Exact visual rendering is critical
4. The content will eventually be fully redesigned

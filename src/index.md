## Welcome to the Enterprise Design System

The Enterprise Design System (EDS) provides a comprehensive set of design guidelines, components, and resources for building consistent, accessible, and user-friendly enterprise applications. Our goal is to streamline the design and development process, reduce redundancy, and create a cohesive user experience across all enterprise products.

### Recent Updates

- **Version 2.0 Released**: Our latest version includes improved accessibility, new components, and enhanced documentation. [Learn more](/updates/2025-02-15-version-2-release/)
- **Dark Mode Support**: All components now support dark mode out of the box, with seamless theme switching.
- **Expanded Component Library**: We've added 15 new components based on user feedback and real-world use cases.

### About the Design System

The Enterprise Design System is built on the following principles:

1. **Consistency**: Creating a unified experience across all enterprise applications.
2. **Accessibility**: Ensuring all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
3. **Flexibility**: Providing components that can be customized to meet various needs.
4. **Performance**: Optimizing components for fast load times and smooth interactions.
5. **Maintainability**: Creating a system that is easy to update and extend.

Foundations
The core design elements that form the building blocks of our design system

Foundations
Foundations are the core design elements that form the building blocks of our design system. They establish the visual language of our products and ensure consistency across all interfaces.

Core Foundation Elements
Color
Our color palette system, including primary and secondary colors, semantic colors, neutrals, and usage guidelines.

Typography Example
Typography
Our typefaces, font weights, sizes, and styles for headings, body text, and UI elements.

Spacing
Our spacing scale and system for consistent layout, padding, and margins across all interfaces.

Iconography
Our icon system, including usage guidelines, sizing, and available icon sets.

Purpose of Foundations
Foundation elements should be used consistently

Foundations provide the basic building blocks for all design work. Use them consistently to create cohesive and harmonious interfaces.

Foundations serve several critical purposes in our design system:

1. Establish a Consistent Visual Language
Foundations set the visual tone for all our products. By using consistent colors, typography, spacing, and other foundational elements, we create a cohesive look and feel across all interfaces.

2. Improve Design Efficiency
With pre-defined foundation elements, designers can make decisions more quickly and focus on solving user problems rather than debating basic visual choices.

3. Ensure Accessibility and Usability
Our foundations are designed with accessibility in mind. The color system includes contrast checking, typography ensures readability, and spacing creates clear visual hierarchies.

4. Support Theming and Customization
While consistency is important, our foundations also support theming and customization through design tokens that can be adjusted to meet specific brand needs.

5. Create a Shared Design Vocabulary
Foundations create a shared language for designers and developers to communicate efficiently about interface elements.

How to Use Foundations
When working on designs or implementations, always start with the foundation elements. They provide the basic building blocks for all other components and patterns.

Example: Building a Card Component
When designing or implementing a card component, use foundation elements:

Colors: Use the defined background, border, and text colors
Typography: Follow heading and body text guidelines
Spacing: Apply consistent padding and margins using the spacing scale
Elevation: Use the appropriate shadow for the card's visual hierarchy

Card Title

This is an example card that uses our foundation elements consistently, including color, typography, and spacing.


Primary Action
Implementation Principles
When implementing foundation elements in your designs and code, follow these principles:

Use Design Tokens
Design tokens are named entities that store visual design attributes. Use design tokens rather than hard-coded values to ensure consistency and support theming.

/* Don't use hard-coded values */
.button {
  background-color: #0056b3;
  padding: 12px 16px;
}

/* Do use design tokens */
.button {
  background-color: var(--color-primary);
  padding: var(--space-3) var(--space-4);
}
Follow Documentation Closely
Each foundation element has specific usage guidelines. Follow these guidelines closely to ensure proper implementation and avoid inconsistencies.

Use Foundation Elements as Building Blocks
Foundations should be the building blocks for all other components and patterns. Start with foundations, then build more complex elements on top of them.

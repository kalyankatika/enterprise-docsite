EDS Goal summary – Redesign and re-build design.firm.com to optimize the user experience and scale our support of enterprise and product-specific materials.
Designers and developers must be able to easily find and apply EDS-approved materials and guidelines to the products they're working on, in ways that align with EDS standards. 
Contributions from approved EDS partners must be integrated in ways that make it easy for the user to find these materials to their experiences, while making clear the proper channels for support and maintenance
Internal EDS team members and EDS Partners must be able to edit basic site content without having coding knowledge. Markdown is OK.
 
Design and build process
I'd like to see a full design process for this complex project
Collaborative design, content, & dev
Produce multiple options for review and evaluation
Perform quick-hit reviews with users
Let's get a rough roadmap together to keep ourselves on track and able to communicate milestones to stakeholders
 
Site content - Site should include all the materials that are required to design and build EDS-compliant, front-end experiences, including (but not limited to)

Design language foundations
Onboarding materials for devs and designers
Guidance for designers and devs for assembling experiences using the materials provided (how does it all fit together, what are the types of assets we provide and what is the role of each)
Inventories of design system assets (let's confirm terminology we're using; and to clarify, the IA doesn't have to be organized this way)
Components
Compound components
Templates
Design patterns

For the design system assets:
design.firm.com should become the access point for all design system assets, including assets currently on legacy docsite1, legacy docsite2, and legacy docsite3
There should be ways to see only assets that apply to the product I'm working on
There should be asset-specific guidance and documentation for devs and designers
There should be ways to get clarity on who created, owns, and supports any given asset
Access to support and comms channels
Access to related and external resources

DOCSITE Consolidation requirements:
If we take the structure that exists across all three docsites, we’ll have the following:

EDS / Legacy docsite1 / Legacy docsite2 Component Pages Combined
Summary at the top
Categorized tabs
Static or interactive examples on page
Component specifications: Behavior, variations, Design spec, accessibility, content
Code snippets included on page
On-page navigational element (currently right-hand)
Help resources (report bug, request feature, get help)
Consistent page structure
Version of component

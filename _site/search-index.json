        "content": "About the accordion component The accordion component is used to show and hide content in a limited space. Users can expand sections they&amp;#039;re interested in and collapse others to focus on relevant information. This pattern is particularly useful for: FAQ sections Product descriptions with multiple categories Settings or configuration options Navigation in limited spaces Accessibility considerations When implementing accordions, ensure they&amp;#039;re accessible by: Using proper ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls) Supporting keyboard navigation Providing sufficient color contrast Ensuring content is announced correctly to screen readers Best practices For the best user experience with accordions: Use descriptive headings that clearly indicate content Keep content concise and focused Consider whether users need to compare information across sections Provide visual feedback for interactions Consider allowing multiple sections to be open simultaneously // Example functionality document.querySelectorAll(&amp;#039;.accordion-header&amp;#039;).forEach(button =&amp;gt; { button.addEventListener(&amp;#039;click&amp;#039;, () =&amp;gt; { const expanded = button.getAttribute(&amp;#039;aria-expanded&amp;#039;) === &amp;#039;true&amp;#039;; button.setAttribute(&amp;#039;aria-expanded&amp;#039;, !expanded); const panelId = button.getAttribute(&amp;#039;aria-controls&amp;#039;); const panel = document.getElementById(panelId); if (panel) { panel.hidden = expanded; } }); }); .accordion { width: 100%; border: 1px solid var(--color-border); border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2rem; } .accordion-item { border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-border); } .accordion-item:last-child { border-bottom: none; } .accordion-header { width: 100%; padding: 1rem; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; background: none; border: none; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; } .accordion-header:hover { background-color: var(--color-bg-hover); } .accordion-icon { transition: transform 0.2s ease; } .accordion-header[aria-expanded=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;] .accordion-icon { transform: rotate(180deg); } .accordion-panel { padding: 0; margin: 0; overflow: hidden; } .accordion-content { padding: 0 1rem 1rem; }",

        "content": "Typography # Typography plays a crucial role in creating clear, readable, and hierarchical interfaces. Our typography system provides guidelines for using fonts consistently across all enterprise applications. Font Families # The Enterprise Design System uses a combination of sans-serif and monospace fonts to create a professional and readable interface. Primary Font: Inter Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee 0123456789!@#$%^&amp;amp;*() Inter is used for all primary text, including headings, body text, and UI elements. It provides excellent readability at various sizes and weights. Monospace: IBM Plex Mono Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee 0123456789!@#$%^&amp;amp;*() IBM Plex Mono is used for code snippets, technical content, and data-focused UI elements where a monospaced font enhances readability. Type Scale # Our type scale is designed to create clear hierarchy while maintaining readability across different screen sizes. Name Size Line Height Weight Example Display 36px (2.25rem) 1.2 700 Display Heading 1 30px (1.875rem) 1.25 700 Heading 1 Heading 2 24px (1.5rem) 1.3 600 Heading 2 Heading 3 20px (1.25rem) 1.4 600 Heading 3 Heading 4 18px (1.125rem) 1.4 600 Heading 4 Body 16px (1rem) 1.5 400 Body text Small 14px (0.875rem) 1.5 400 Small text Caption 12px (0.75rem) 1.5 400 Caption text Font Weights # We use a range of font weights to create hierarchy and emphasis in our interfaces. Font Light (300) Used sparingly for large display text. Font Regular (400) Default weight for body text and most UI elements. Font Medium (500) Used for emphasis and importance within body text. Font Semibold (600) Used for subheadings and important UI elements. Font Bold (700) Used for headings and primary actions. Usage Guidelines # Hierarchy # Create clear hierarchies using a combination of size, weight, and color. Limit the number of type styles on a single screen to maintain visual order. Page Title Page subtitle or description Section Heading This is regular body text. It should be used for the main content of your interface. Keep paragraphs concise and focused on a single idea to improve readability. Subsection Heading Another paragraph of body text showing the hierarchy in action. This is small text, used for secondary information, captions, or helper text. Responsive Typography # Our typography system is designed to work across all screen sizes. Font sizes automatically adjust for different viewports to maintain readability. Responsive Typography Our typography scales down proportionally on mobile devices to maintain readability while preserving hierarchy. No additional code is required to support this behavior. Accessibility # Follow these guidelines to ensure typography is accessible to all users: Maintain a minimum font size of 14px (0.875rem) for body text. Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and its background. Avoid using font weight as the only visual differentiator. Don&amp;#039;t use all caps for lengthy text blocks. Keep line lengths between 60-80 characters for optimal readability. Technical Implementation # CSS Variables # Our typography system is implemented using CSS variables that can be used across your application: :root { /* Font families */ --eds-font-sans: &amp;#039;Inter&amp;#039;, system-ui, sans-serif; --eds-font-mono: &amp;#039;IBM Plex Mono&amp;#039;, monospace; /* Font sizes */ --eds-font-size-xs: 0.75rem; /* 12px */ --eds-font-size-sm: 0.875rem; /* 14px */ --eds-font-size-base: 1rem; /* 16px */ --eds-font-size-lg: 1.125rem; /* 18px */ --eds-font-size-xl: 1.25rem; /* 20px */ --eds-font-size-2xl: 1.5rem; /* 24px */ --eds-font-size-3xl: 1.875rem; /* 30px */ --eds-font-size-4xl: 2.25rem; /* 36px */ /* Line heights */ --eds-line-height-tight: 1.2; --eds-line-height-snug: 1.25; --eds-line-height-normal: 1.4; --eds-line-height-relaxed: 1.5; --eds-line-height-loose: 1.75; } Tailwind CSS # When using our design system with Tailwind CSS, the following classes map to our typography system: Font families: font-eds-sans, font-eds-mono Font sizes: text-xs, text-sm, text-base, text-lg, text-xl, text-2xl, text-3xl, text-4xl Font weights: font-light, font-normal, font-medium, font-semibold, font-bold Line heights: leading-tight, leading-snug, leading-normal, leading-relaxed, leading-loose Related Resources # Colors - Color guidelines and specifications Spacing - Spacing guidelines and scale Design Tokens - Technical implementation of our design system Accessibility - Accessibility guidelines and best practices",

        "content": "Spacing # A consistent spacing system helps create balanced layouts and establish rhythmic relationships between elements. Our spacing scale is based on a 4px grid, providing predictable and harmonious spacing throughout interfaces. Spacing Scale # Our spacing scale follows a geometric progression to provide a natural and harmonious spacing rhythm: Token Value Pixels Rem Visual Example Usage space-0 0 0px 0rem No spacing space-1 0.25 4px 0.25rem Very tight spacing between related elements space-2 0.5 8px 0.5rem Tight spacing between closely related elements space-3 0.75 12px 0.75rem Spacing between related elements space-4 1 16px 1rem Standard spacing between elements (base unit) space-6 1.5 24px 1.5rem Medium spacing between distinct elements space-8 2 32px 2rem Standard section spacing space-12 3 48px 3rem Large section spacing space-16 4 64px 4rem Spacing between major sections space-20 5 80px 5rem Extra large section spacing space-24 6 96px 6rem Very large section spacing Spacing Usage Guidelines # To create consistent and harmonious layouts, follow these guidelines when applying spacing: 1. Use the spacing scale consistently # Always use the predefined spacing values instead of arbitrary values. This ensures consistency across all interfaces and maintains the design system&amp;#039;s rhythm. Do Header Content Footer Use consistent spacing (space-4 or 16px) between sections Don&amp;#039;t Header Content Footer Use inconsistent or arbitrary spacing values (12px, 20px) 2. Apply spacing hierarchically # Use smaller spacing values for related elements and larger values to separate distinct sections. This creates visual grouping that helps users understand the relationship between elements. Card Component Card Title This is an example card with proper spacing hierarchy. Item 1 Item 2 space-2 (8px): Between icon and text (closely related elements) space-4 (16px): Between card content sections space-8 (32px): Between cards (distinct elements) 3. Consider component density # Adjust spacing based on the desired density of your interface. High-density UIs (like dashboards or data tables) should use smaller spacing values, while marketing pages or content-focused pages can use larger spacing for readability. High Density UI Item 1 Value Item 2 Value Item 3 Value Uses smaller spacing values (space-1, space-2) Content UI This is an example of content-focused UI with more generous spacing. The additional whitespace improves readability and reduces cognitive load. Uses larger spacing values (space-3, space-4) 4. Be responsive # Adjust spacing based on screen size. Consider using smaller spacing values on mobile devices and larger values on desktop to optimize for different viewport sizes. Responsive Spacing Our design system utilizes Tailwind CSS utility classes for responsive spacing. For example, class=&amp;quot;mt-4 md:mt-6 lg:mt-8&amp;quot; applies different spacing at different breakpoints. Implementation # CSS Variables # Our spacing scale is implemented using CSS variables: :root { --space-0: 0; --space-1: 0.25rem; /* 4px */ --space-2: 0.5rem; /* 8px */ --space-3: 0.75rem; /* 12px */ --space-4: 1rem; /* 16px */ --space-6: 1.5rem; /* 24px */ --space-8: 2rem; /* 32px */ --space-12: 3rem; /* 48px */ --space-16: 4rem; /* 64px */ --space-20: 5rem; /* 80px */ --space-24: 6rem; /* 96px */ } Using Spacing in Components # When building components, use the spacing variables to ensure consistency: .card { padding: var(--space-4); margin-bottom: var(--space-6); } .card-content { margin-bottom: var(--space-4); } .card-item { margin-bottom: var(--space-2); } Utility Classes # You can also use our utility classes for margin and padding, which follow the same spacing scale: m-{size} - Margin on all sides mx-{size} - Horizontal margin (left and right) my-{size} - Vertical margin (top and bottom) mt-{size}, mr-{size}, mb-{size}, ml-{size} - Margin top, right, bottom, left p-{size} - Padding on all sides px-{size} - Horizontal padding (left and right) py-{size} - Vertical padding (top and bottom) pt-{size}, pr-{size}, pb-{size}, pl-{size} - Padding top, right, bottom, left Where {size} corresponds to the spacing scale values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24).

They establish the visual language of our products and ensure consistency across all interfaces. Core Foundation Elements # Color Our color palette system, including primary and secondary colors, semantic colors, neutrals, and usage guidelines. View Color System → Typography Example Typography Our typefaces, font weights, sizes, and styles for headings, body text, and UI elements. View Typography System → Spacing Our spacing scale and system for consistent layout, padding, and margins across all interfaces. View Spacing System → Iconography Our icon system, including usage guidelines, sizing, and available icon sets. View Icon System → Grid System Our responsive grid system for consistent layouts across all screen sizes. View Grid System → Accessibility Our accessibility guidelines and best practices for creating inclusive interfaces. View Accessibility Guidelines → Purpose of Foundations # Foundation elements should be used consistently Foundations provide the basic building blocks for all design work. Use them consistently to create cohesive and harmonious interfaces. Foundations serve several critical purposes in our design system: 1. Establish a Consistent Visual Language # Foundations set the visual tone for all our products. By using consistent colors, typography, spacing, and other foundational elements, we create a cohesive look and feel across all interfaces. 2. Improve Design Efficiency # With pre-defined foundation elements, designers can make decisions more quickly and focus on solving user problems rather than debating basic visual choices. 3. Ensure Accessibility and Usability # Our foundations are designed with accessibility in mind. The color system includes contrast checking, typography ensures readability, and spacing creates clear visual hierarchies. 4. Support Theming and Customization # While consistency is important, our foundations also support theming and customization through design tokens that can be adjusted to meet specific brand needs. 5. Create a Shared Design Vocabulary # Foundations create a shared language for designers and developers to communicate efficiently about interface elements. How to Use Foundations # When working on designs or implementations, always start with the foundation elements. They provide the basic building blocks for all other components and patterns. Example: Building a Card Component When designing or implementing a card component, use foundation elements: Colors: Use the defined background, border, and text colors Typography: Follow heading and body text guidelines Spacing: Apply consistent padding and margins using the spacing scale Elevation: Use the appropriate shadow for the card&amp;#039;s visual hierarchy Card Title This is an example card that uses our foundation elements consistently, including color, typography, and spacing. Primary Action Implementation Principles # When implementing foundation elements in your designs and code, follow these principles: Use Design Tokens # Design tokens are named entities that store visual design attributes. Use design tokens rather than hard-coded values to ensure consistency and support theming. /* Don&amp;#039;t use hard-coded values */ .button { background-color: #0056b3; padding: 12px 16px; } /* Do use design tokens */ .button { background-color: var(--color-primary); padding: var(--space-3) var(--space-4); } Follow Documentation Closely # Each foundation element has specific usage guidelines. Follow these guidelines closely to ensure proper implementation and avoid inconsistencies. Use Foundation Elements as Building Blocks # Foundations should be the building blocks for all other components and patterns. Start with foundations, then build more complex elements on top of them.

This guide will help you get started with implementing EDS in your projects. Who is this for? This guide is intended for developers and designers who are implementing the Enterprise Design System in their projects. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is recommended. Installation Using npm Install the EDS package from npm: npm install @enterprise/design-system Using a CDN You can also include EDS directly from a CDN: &amp;amp;lt;link rel=&amp;amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;amp;quot; href=&amp;amp;quot;https://cdn.enterprise.com/design-system/2.0.0/eds.min.css&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;script src=&amp;amp;quot;https://cdn.enterprise.com/design-system/2.0.0/eds.min.js&amp;amp;quot; defer&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/script&amp;amp;gt; Usage Basic Setup Include the CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML: &amp;amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;html lang=&amp;amp;quot;en&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;head&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;meta name=&amp;amp;quot;viewport&amp;amp;quot; content=&amp;amp;quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;title&amp;amp;gt;My Enterprise App&amp;amp;lt;/title&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;link rel=&amp;amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;amp;quot; href=&amp;amp;quot;path/to/eds.min.css&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;/head&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;body&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;!-- Your content here --&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;script src=&amp;amp;quot;path/to/eds.min.js&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/script&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;/body&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;/html&amp;amp;gt; Using Components Once the EDS is set up, you can use components by following the HTML structure and CSS classes documented in the Components section. Here&amp;#039;s a simple example using a button component: &amp;amp;lt;button class=&amp;amp;quot;eds-button eds-button--primary&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;Primary Button&amp;amp;lt;/button&amp;amp;gt; Key Concepts BEM Methodology The EDS uses the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention with an &amp;#039;eds-&amp;#039; prefix for all CSS classes. This helps to create a consistent and predictable class naming structure. Block: A standalone entity that is meaningful on its own (e.g., eds-button) Element: A part of a block that has no standalone meaning (e.g., eds-card__title) Modifier: A flag on a block or element that changes appearance or behavior (e.g., eds-button--primary) Design Tokens Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. The EDS uses design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and more. You can access these tokens through CSS variables: .custom-element { color: var(--eds-color-primary); padding: var(--eds-spacing-md); font-size: var(--eds-font-size-lg); } Browser Support The Enterprise Design System supports the following browsers: Chrome (latest 2 versions) Firefox (latest 2 versions) Safari (latest 2 versions) Edge (latest 2 versions) Internet Explorer 11 (with polyfills) Next Steps Explore Components Browse our library of UI components and learn how to use them in your project.

These tools are designed to preserve content structure and formatting while converting to Markdown format, which is the standard for our documentation. Available Migration Utilities # The following migration utilities are available to help you convert content from various sources: HTML to Markdown Converter # Converts HTML-based legacy sites to Markdown format. This utility can handle: Generic HTML content Confluence-specific HTML formats SharePoint-specific HTML formats Jira documentation WordPress content XML to Markdown Converter # Converts XML-based documentation formats to Markdown, supporting: DITA XML DocBook XML Generic XML structures Nunjucks to Markdown Converter # Converts Nunjucks templates to Markdown format, useful for migrating from other 11ty-based sites. Markdown Formatter # Formats and normalizes converted Markdown files to ensure they adhere to our documentation standards and styling conventions. Migration CLI Tool # We provide a command-line interface (CLI) tool that makes it easy to run migrations either on individual files or in batch mode for entire directories. Installation # The migration tools are included in the repository. Before using them, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed: npm install Basic Usage # Single File Conversion # To convert a single file from a legacy format to Markdown: node scripts/migration/migrate.js convert source.html destination.md --type html Batch Conversion # To convert multiple files in a directory: node scripts/migration/migrate.js batch source-directory/ destination-directory/ --type html Configuration File # For more complex migration scenarios, you can create a configuration file: node scripts/migration/migrate.js schema migration-config.yml Then use the configuration file in your migration: node scripts/migration/migrate.js batch source-directory/ destination-directory/ --config migration-config.yml Migration Options # The migration tools support the following options: Option Description --type Source file type (html, xml, njk) --site-type Type of site (confluence, sharepoint, jira, wordpress) --front-matter Additional front matter as JSON string --config Path to a YAML configuration file --recursive Process directories recursively (for batch operations) --pattern File name pattern to match (for batch operations) Best Practices for Content Migration # When migrating content from legacy systems, consider the following best practices: Preparation # Content Audit: Perform a content audit to identify what needs to be migrated and what can be discarded. Structure Planning: Map the structure of your legacy content to the new documentation structure. Test Migration: Run test migrations on a small subset of content before processing everything. During Migration # Preserve Metadata: Make sure to capture and convert any metadata like authors, dates, and categories. Handle Images: Ensure images are properly transferred and references are updated. Check Links: Update internal links to reflect the new structure. Post-Migration # Format Review: Review the formatting of migrated content to ensure it meets our standards. Structural Check: Verify the structure and navigation of the migrated content. Fix Broken Elements: Address any elements that didn&amp;#039;t convert properly. Example: Migrating from Confluence # Here&amp;#039;s an example of migrating content from Confluence: # Create a migration configuration node scripts/migration/migrate.js schema confluence-migration.yml # Edit the configuration file to customize settings # Run the migration node scripts/migration/migrate.js batch confluence-export/ src/migrated-content/ --config confluence-migration.yml # Format the migrated content node src/utils/migration/md-formatter.js batch src/migrated-content/ Example Configuration File # Here&amp;#039;s an example of a migration configuration file: # Migration Configuration type: html siteType: confluence # Processing options options: recursive: true pattern: &amp;quot;*.html&amp;quot; # Image handling images: handling: copy destDir: &amp;quot;src/assets/images/migrated&amp;quot; baseUrl: &amp;quot;/assets/images/migrated&amp;quot; # Front matter to add to all converted files frontMatter: layout: layouts/base.njk eleventyNavigation: key: Migrated Content parent: Documentation tags: - migrated migrationSource: &amp;quot;Confluence&amp;quot; migrationDate: &amp;quot;2025-02-27&amp;quot; Technical Documentation # For detailed technical documentation on the migration utilities, refer to: HTML to Markdown Converter API XML to Markdown Converter API Nunjucks to Markdown Converter API Markdown Formatter API Getting Help # If you encounter issues with the migration tools, please reach out to the Documentation Team or file an issue in the repository.",

Follow these guidelines to ensure your accordions meet accessibility standards. ARIA Roles and Attributes Use aria-expanded on the header button to indicate the expanded/collapsed state Include aria-controls on the header button that points to the ID of the content panel Apply role=&amp;amp;quot;region&amp;amp;quot; to the content panel with aria-labelledby pointing to the header ID Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate ARIA roles and states Use aria-disabled=&amp;amp;quot;true&amp;amp;quot; when an accordion is disabled but still visible Keyboard Navigation Key Function Tab Moves focus to the accordion header Enter or Space Toggles the accordion panel between expanded and collapsed states Arrow Down When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the next accordion header Arrow Up When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the previous accordion header Home When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the first accordion header End When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the last accordion header Implementation Here&amp;#039;s how to correctly implement an accessible accordion: &amp;amp;lt;div class=&amp;amp;quot;eds-accordion&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;h3&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;button id=&amp;amp;quot;accordion-header-1&amp;amp;quot; class=&amp;amp;quot;eds-accordion__header&amp;amp;quot; aria-expanded=&amp;amp;quot;false&amp;amp;quot; aria-controls=&amp;amp;quot;accordion-panel-1&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt; Accordion Heading &amp;amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;eds-accordion__icon&amp;amp;quot; aria-hidden=&amp;amp;quot;true&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;/button&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;/h3&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;div id=&amp;amp;quot;accordion-panel-1&amp;amp;quot; class=&amp;amp;quot;eds-accordion__content&amp;amp;quot; role=&amp;amp;quot;region&amp;amp;quot; aria-labelledby=&amp;amp;quot;accordion-header-1&amp;amp;quot; hidden&amp;amp;gt; Accordion content goes here. &amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;gt; Don&amp;#039;t use role=&amp;amp;quot;button&amp;amp;quot; on elements that aren&amp;#039;t naturally focused in the tab order. Instead, use a semantic button element to ensure proper keyboard interaction. Testing Criteria Ensure your accordion passes these accessibility checks: Accordion headers must be focusable and operable with a keyboard State changes must be programmatically announced to screen readers Focus must remain on the header after expanding/collapsing Content must be properly associated with its header Color contrast must meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text) Icons must have sufficient contrast and not rely solely on color Animations must respect user preferences via the prefers-reduced-motion media query WAI-ARIA Compliance The accordion component follows the WAI-ARIA Accordion Pattern. This ensures consistency with established accessibility standards and patterns. Required ARIA Attributes Attribute Applied to Purpose aria-expanded Accordion header button Indicates whether the accordion panel is expanded or collapsed aria-controls Accordion header button References the ID of the controlled panel aria-labelledby Accordion panel References the ID of the header for labeling role=&amp;amp;quot;region&amp;amp;quot; Accordion panel Identifies the element as a region when expanded When using role=&amp;amp;quot;region&amp;amp;quot;, it&amp;#039;s important to ensure the region has an accessible name using aria-labelledby to avoid ARIA validation errors. Responsive Considerations For users on mobile or touch devices: Ensure touch targets (accordion headers) are at least 44×44 pixels Provide sufficient spacing between adjacent accordion headers to prevent accidental taps Consider starting with all accordions collapsed on mobile to minimize initial scrolling Ensure text remains readable at smaller viewport sizes Adapt padding and margins for comfortable viewing on small screens Screen Reader Announcements When implemented correctly, screen readers should announce the following when interacting with an accordion: Action Announcement Focus on collapsed header &amp;amp;quot;Accordion Heading, collapsed, button&amp;amp;quot; Expand accordion &amp;amp;quot;Accordion Heading, expanded, button&amp;amp;quot; Collapse accordion &amp;amp;quot;Accordion Heading, collapsed, button&amp;amp;quot; Focus on disabled header &amp;amp;quot;Accordion Heading, button, disabled&amp;amp;quot; Test your accordions with real screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver to ensure they work as expected.",

Performance Optimization This accordion uses custom colors and icons to match a specific visual style. You can adapt the styling to fit your application&amp;#039;s design system.

Key Elements 1 Header - Contains the accordion title and expansion control 2 Icon - Indicates the current state (expanded or collapsed) 3 Content Area - Contains the information revealed when the accordion is expanded Structured breakdown and detailed description of the components and their relationships within a user interface. Considerations When to use the accordion component If you have a large amount of content to display within a page When users need to focus on specific sections of information To reduce scrolling and make content more scannable When content can be logically divided into discrete sections For FAQ sections or hierarchical information When to use something else If users need to see all content at once for comparison If there&amp;#039;s not enough content to warrant progressive disclosure When the content hierarchy is less important If users will frequently need to switch between multiple sections For critical information that should always be visible Key factors and criteria that influence design decisions regarding component choice for alignment with user needs and design system guidelines. Usage General Usage Guidelines Group related content Organize information into logical sections with descriptive headers. Clear heading content Use concise, descriptive headings to help users understand the hidden content. Consider default states Determine whether accordions should be collapsed or expanded by default based on user needs. Consistent interaction pattern Ensure the entire header area is clickable, not just the icon or text. Support keyboard navigation Ensure accordions can be operated with keyboard controls for accessibility. Guidelines and best practices for the implementation of design components, ensuring they are used consistently and appropriately when applied. Behavior Expanding When a user clicks or focuses and presses Enter on the accordion header, the content area expands. The icon rotates 180 degrees to indicate the expanded state. By default, multiple accordion sections can be open simultaneously, but this behavior can be configured to allow only one open section at a time. Collapsing When a user clicks an expanded accordion header, the content area collapses and is hidden from view. The icon rotates back to its original position. Focus States When users tab through the page, the accordion headers receive a visible focus indicator to support keyboard navigation. Highlights interactive and dynamic aspects of design components, detailing how they respond to user actions and changes in state in relation to the user experience. Best Practices Do Keep accordion headings short, clear, and descriptive Prioritize content within accordions based on user needs Ensure consistent spacing between accordion items Consider expandable and collapsible animations for smooth transitions Use appropriate ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility Don&amp;#039;t Nest accordions within accordions (avoid excessive nesting) Hide critical information that users need immediately Include too many accordions on a single page (cognitive overload) Use non-descriptive headings that don&amp;#039;t clearly indicate content Rely solely on color to indicate the accordion state Content Ensure accordion headings are descriptive and self-sufficient Avoid repetitive or redundant information across accordion sections Place most important content in the first few accordions Keep content within each accordion section focused and concise Consider using icons or visual cues to improve scannability Ensure content hierarchy makes sense in the context of the page The recommended methods and strategies for designing and implementing components, ensuring efficiency and consistent use.
